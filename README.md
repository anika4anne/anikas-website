Why did I make this website?
I made it to document my personal projects and showcase my skills. It's like my personal portfolio, where I can store my achievements and look back on them.

Images:

This is my homepage. I originally had a flower opening planned with a ribbon untying, but I spent too much time working on that, and in the end, it didn't work out. So i decided to stick with my normal homepage, as you can see below

For my skills page, I'm interested in all the icons of the tools I can use, and added a confetti effect

Below is my projects page, you can see all the past projects I've worked on, and if you click on a project it expands and tells you more about what I did.

This is my hobbies page, I wanted to dedicate a section in my website for all the hobbies i take part in. I've added a cool animation where the icons/emojis fade in, in a clockwise circle.

And if you hover over any of my hobbies, it shows you a picture of me doing the hobby, and shows a timeline of how long I've done it, and my achievements
